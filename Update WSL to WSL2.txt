To update WSL to WSL 2
======================
1. Open PS as admin
2. Make sure WSL is installed
	dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux /all /norestart

3. Make sure virtual machine platform is enabled:
	dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:VirtualMachinePlatform /all /norestart

4. Set WSL to version 2 for new added distributions (and check afterwards):
	wsl --set-default-version 2
	wsl -l -v			(lists the used WSL version per distro)
