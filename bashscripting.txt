Bash scripting
==============
bash --version  : check version
echo $SHELL     : check current shell
chsh            : change shell if you would like to (ksh, zsh etc)

piping and redirecting
----------------------
ls | wc        : counts the words as result from the directory listing
ls > list.txt  : writes listing to output file
ls 1> list.txt : same
cat < list.txt : show content from saved file

ls oopsy 1> success.txt 2> error.txt  : write to file depending on fail/success
ls oopsy 1> success.txt 2>> error.txt : append to error.txt, overwite success.txt

'Here' document (to easy display multiple lines of text):
cat << EndOfTag
This is a 
text over multiple lines
without using echo or newline chars
EndOfTag

Bash builtins and other commands
--------------------------------
Bash has some builtin commands that can differ from the other versions
command echo Hello  : run echo (separate program)
builtin echo Hello  : run echo (Bash builtin)

command -V echo : shows which version of echo is used / info about the command
To disable using builtin version: enable -n echo
Now command -V echo will tell you that you use the /usr/bin/echo
To enable the builtin again just use: enable echo
If there is only a builtin version like with command 'history' disabling it will cause that the command will not work anymore. Only use it when there is an extra
version that you want to use to override the builtin version.

enable -n : show all the disabled builtins

Be aware that the help info for builtins is different:
- for builtins     : help <command>
- for non builtins : man <command> or another help option

Output/formatting
-----------------
Output in columns instead of list: <command> | columns

Using ~, (), {} and (())
------------------------
echo ~ = home location
cd ~ = go to home
cd ~- = got to previous f

brace expansion: creates sets or ranges ({..})
- echo /tmp/file{one,two,three} : /tmp/fileone  /tmp/filetwo  /tmp/filethree
- touch file{01..3}.txt  : creates file01.txt, file02.txt and file02.txt in one go
- touch file_{01..12}{a..d}  : combining; creates 12 * 4 = 48 files: file_01a t/m file_12d
- echo {1..10} outputs : 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
- echo {01..10} outputs: 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 10
- echo {a..z..2} outputs: a c e g i k m o q s u w y
- echo {1..10..2} output: 1 3 5 7 9
- echo {cat,dog,fox}_{1..2} : cat_1, dog_1, fox_1, cat_2, dog_2 and fox_2

parameter expansion: retrieves and transforms stored values (${..})
- g="Hello there!"; echo Output\: ${g}     : Output: Hello there!
- g="Hello there!"; echo Output\: ${g:6}   : Output: there!   (position 6)
- g="Hello there!"; echo Output\: ${g:6:3} : Output: the      (position 6, then 3 chars)
- g='Hallo daar!'; echo ${g/a/e}           : Hello daar!      (/ : replaces first a by e) 
- g='Hallo daar!'; echo ${g//a/e}          : Hello deer!      (//: replaces all a's by e's) 
- g='Hallo daar!'; echo ${g^^[ao]}         : HAllO dAAr!      (^^: uppercase all a's and o's) 

arithmetic expansion: math ( $((..)) )
- echo $((2+2)) : 4

Text editor for bash
--------------------
preferred nano -> check Learning Nano course

How to bash
----------
- multiple commands separated by semicolons
- create bash scripts and make them executable
