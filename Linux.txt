-----
sudo <command> : do things as root temporarily
sudo -k : go back to normal user
sudo -s : login as root user
sudo !! : repeat last command as root user (if you forgot to type sudo ..)

change file access:/rights:
chmod <user priv digit><group priv digit><other priv digit>
read = 4, write = 2, execute = 1
x=1, w=2, xw=3, r=4, xr=5, rw=6, xrw=7
Example: chmod 664 poems.txt means:
- user:rw, group:rw, others: r only
Also possible notation with +, - and = for user, group, others or all.
chmod 777 = a+rwx              full access for everyone
chmod 755 = u+rwx,g=rx,o=rx    owners full access, group only rx, others only rx
chmod 700 = u=rwx,g-rwx,o-rwx  owners full access, rest none

change ownership: sudo chown <new owner> <file>
change group    : sudo chgrp <new owner> <file>
