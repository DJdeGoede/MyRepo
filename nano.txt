Nano
====
Popular text editor on linux

Handy switches:
- start with line nrs: nano -l <file>

nano <file> [..<file>] &       Start nano as a job in the background
fg                             Take job to the foreground / activate nano
Alt-Z                          Put nano in the background (suspend)
                               (In Nano: ctrl+Z to switch on or off suspension)
Alt + > or <                   Switch between documents

Show overview of active jobs if there are more jobs running:
jobs -l

Now activate nano with: job %<job nr of nano job>
