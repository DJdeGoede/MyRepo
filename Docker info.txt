List images:			docker images
List containers:		docker ps -a  (or --all)
Show active/running containers	docker ps -f status=running
Show exited containers:		docker ps -f status=exited

Start/create a docker container based on image:
(-ti = terminal interactive)
	docker run -ti <image>:<version> <command>
	example:  docker run -ti ubuntu:latest bash

To start a temporary container: docker run --rm -ti <image> <command>

Create an image based on a changed container:
	- exit the container / make sure it is not running.
	- docker commit <container id>
          Image has now been created with a long sha id and no name. Copy this id.
	  We now need to tag the new image with a readable name:
	- docker tag <created sha id> <image name>
	  Now your new image (copy of the container) is available.

Or in one go:  docker commit <container name> <new image name>
