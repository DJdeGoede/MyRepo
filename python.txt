Python essential training
-------------------------

- preferrably use Komodo Edit/IDE as editor
- Check differences Python 2, 3 and 3.6 and up
- before 3 not object oriented, so big difference in wat of coding

- First line (shebang): #!/usr/bin/env python3
- position is important, always make sure you use right indents
- no case/switch statement avaialble, use if.. elif ..elif .. (etc) ..else statement
- variables do not need a type declaration
- variables always available no matter where in the code (always global)

print
-   to set eol character that is not \n (newline) use: print(.. , end='..)
    When it is set to ' ' it will concat print output in a loop

    When you change the end parameter the buffer is no longer being flushed which can cause the output not to be shown.
    When end is set (like end=' ') then also set Flush=True !

-   to set the separator within a print statement use: print(.. , sep='..'
