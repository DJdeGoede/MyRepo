==============
install and check
-----------------
Install         : sudo apt install tmux
Check version   : tmux -V

Start tmux by just typing 'tmux'
It will start a new bash session in the same window.
Below you will see a bar indicating you are using tmux with session info left and
some other info to the right. 
* = current window, - = previous window
The bar is fully configurable (check later on).

bind-key
--------
Most commands are given via combination of the 'bind-key' + other key combination
The 'bind-key' is default set to: <ctrl><b>. First press these, let go and then
use another key or key combo as described.
To show help and all combo's:
    bind-key + ?   --> So that means: ctrl + b, let go and then ?

Some keys are abbreviated:
C-.. means: ctrl + ..
M-.. means: alt + ..
