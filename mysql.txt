MySQL
-----
Check if MySQL is not already installed:
1. ps ax | grep mysql   	: should return only this command as a process
2. ls -al /usr/sbin/mysql*	: should return a no such file or directory
3. ls -al /usr/bin/mysql*	: should return a no such file or directory
4. ls -al /usr/lib/mysql*	: should return a no such file or directory
5. ls -al /var/bin/mysql*	: should return a no such file or directory

Install:
- Got to https://dev.mysql.com/downloads
- Choose  for MySQL community downloads
- Select the MySQL APT Repository which is for Debian based Linux systems
  like Ubuntu
- Download the deb file to your ~/Desktop or anywhere else.
- Go to that location in your terminal and type:
    sudo dpkg -i <name downloaded file>
- After some file action you get the Package configuration UI screen
- select the top option: MySQL Server & Cluster
- select mysql-8.0 
- select MySQL Tools & Connectors and then Enabled
- select Ok and you get back to the prompt 
  (ignore the warning as long as it says OK at the bottom)
- sudo apt-get update  to get the packages needed for install
  (based on made choices above)
- sudo apt-get -y install mysql-server
- after some file action a UI appears
- set root password: mysql
- Use strong password encryption  and file action continues..
- After some time the prompt returns and you are done :)

To verify the install:
- ps ax | grep mysql         : should return the /usr/sbin/mysqld process (daemon)
- sudo service mysql status  : should return status info and Active (running)

- Check if you can stop and start:
    - sudo service mysql stop
    - sudo service mysql start
    - sudo service mysql restart (both in one go)
    After verify the status with: sudo service mysql status
    Also check via: ps ax | grep mysql : either gives a daemon or not
